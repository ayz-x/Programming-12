for the project pending review:

in my project, I have randomized terrain generation (tried to simulate minecraft generation but failed),
and as well as added a second constructor to my "map" class, allowing input from 2D array in addition to .txt file.

Additionally, I have added gravity and a jump instead of floating, as well as the ability to move, for example,
z but not x if you are at a 45 degree angle. You will see this in game, if you ram into the wall at an angle.

The hotkey for snowball is 'f'. 

There is also roof headhitter detection implemented, if one were to change the map so that there is a roof.
